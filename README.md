	ALX Africa – Holberton Software Engineering Program’s Printf Group Project.
This Readme file is for a group project, handled by my partner; Chioma Victor and I; Immaculata Etukenyin. It is a custom made printf function for the C programming language called _printf that requires writing codes for functions, flags, presicion, size, width, utils, handlers, a test file and prototypes in main.h files. It takes in various inputs and optional arguments based exactly on how the standard library function printf works. My partner and I, submitted this as our first group project for grading as part of our ALX software engineering course requirement.
